Markov chains can be used in conjunction with other methods, such as computational fluid dynamics, to predict and analyze complex systems.\\n<br><u>Sources</u>: <sup><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.05635v1.pdf?sv=2022-11-02&ss=bf&srt=sco&sp=rltfx&se=2023-11-29T01:50:59Z&st=2023-05-10T16:50:59Z&spr=https&sig=ZT7MLy%2BnlvAxUKKj5v0RwoWObXaab3gO4ec2%2Fci6iL0%3D\">[1]</a></sup><sup><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/ina.12056;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23789964/?sv=2022-11-02&ss=bf&srt=sco&sp=rltfx&se=2023-11-29T01:50:59Z&st=2023-05-10T16:50:59Z&spr=https&sig=ZT7MLy%2BnlvAxUKKj5v0RwoWObXaab3gO4ec2%2Fci6iL0%3D\">[2]</a></sup><sup><a href=\"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.21.20073668v1?rss=1?sv=2022-11-02&ss=bf&srt=sco&sp=rltfx&se=2023-11-29T01:50:59Z&st=2023-05-10T16:50:59Z&spr=https&sig=ZT7MLy%2BnlvAxUKKj5v0RwoWObXaab3gO4ec2%2Fci6iL0%3D\">[3]</a></sup><sup><a href=\"https://demodatasetsp.blob.core.windows.net/arxivcs/0702/0702148v1.pdf?sv=2022-11-02&ss=bf&srt=sco&sp=rltfx&se=2023-11-29T01:50:59Z&st=2023-05-10T16:50:59Z&spr=https&sig=ZT7MLy%2BnlvAxUKKj5v0RwoWObXaab3gO4ec2%2Fci6iL0%3D\">[4]</a></sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7090511/?sv=2022-11-02&ss=bf&srt=sco&sp=rltfx&se=2023-11-29T01:50:59Z&st=2023-05-10T16:50:59Z&spr=https&sig=ZT7MLy%2BnlvAxUKKj5v0RwoWObXaab3gO4ec2%2Fci6iL0%3D\">[5]</a></sup>', additional_kwargs={}, example=False),\n",
