    "- **Notebook 03**: We added AzureOpenAI GPT models to enhance the the production of the answer by using Utility Chains of LLMs\n",
    "- **Notebook 04**: We added memory to our system in order to power a conversational Chat Bot\n",
    "- **Notebook 05**: We introduced Agents and Tools in order to be able to solve a more complex task: ask questions to Tabular datasets\n",
    "- **Notebook 06**: We used a Utility Chain in order to talk to a SQL Database directly\n",
