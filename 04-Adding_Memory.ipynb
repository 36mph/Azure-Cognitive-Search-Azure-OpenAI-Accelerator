First, a new epidemiological meta-population model is constructed, with 379 patches (one for each administrative district in Great Britain), that adequately captures the infection process of pandemic influenza. Second, a ground truth is set up such that the performance of the \\'Proximal Policy Optimization\\' algorithm can be evaluated to learn in a single district of this epidemiological model. Finally, a large-scale experiment is conducted where a joint policy is learned to control the districts in a community of 11 tightly coupled districts, for which no ground truth can be established. This experiment shows that deep reinforcement learning can be used to learn mitigation policies in complex epidemiological models with a large state space. Moreover, through this experiment, it is demonstrated that there can be an advantage to consider collaboration between districts when designing prevention strategies<sup><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.13676v1.pdf?sv=2022-11-02&ss=bf&srt=sco&sp=rltfx&se=2023-11-29T01:50:59Z&st=2023-05-10T16:50:59Z&spr=https&sig=ZT7MLy%2BnlvAxUKKj5v0RwoWObXaab3gO4ec2%2Fci6iL0%3D\">[2]</a></sup>.'"

RL algorithms assign credit to actions based on reinforcement (rewards) from the environment, and the reinforcement may take the form of a cost update or a measurable quantity such as bandwidth or end-to-end delay. RL algorithms converge to solve stochastic shortest-path routing problems, and learning is happening concurrently at all routers, making the reinforcement learning problem for routing a multi-agent reinforcement learning problem. Reinforcement learning can also be used to automatically learn prevention strategies in the context of pandemic influenza<sup><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.13676v1.pdf?sv=2022-11-02&ss=bf&srt=sco&sp=rltfx&se=2023-11-29T01:50:59Z&st=2023-05-10T16:50:59Z&spr=https&sig=ZT7MLy%2BnlvAxUKKj5v0RwoWObXaab3gO4ec2%2Fci6iL0%3D\">[2]</a></sup>. Additionally, reinforcement learning can be used to learn mitigation policies in complex epidemiological models with a large state space<sup><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.13676v1.pdf?sv=2022-11-02&ss=bf&srt=sco&sp=rltfx&se=2023-11-29T01:50:59Z&st=2023-05-10T16:50:59Z&spr=https&sig=ZT7MLy%2BnlvAxUKKj5v0RwoWObXaab3gO4ec2%2Fci6iL0%3D\">[2]</a><sup><a href=\"https://demodatasetsp.blob.core.windows.net/arxivcs/0207/0207073v1.pdf?sv=2022-11-02&ss=bf&srt=sco&sp=rltfx&se=2023-11-29T01:50:59Z&st=2023-05-10T16:50:59Z&spr=https&sig=ZT7MLy%2BnlvAxUKKj5v0RwoWObXaab3gO4ec2%2Fci6iL0%3D\">[1]</a></sup>. \\n\\nRegarding the prevention strategies in the context of pandemic influenza, a deep reinforcement learning approach can be used to automatically learn prevention strategies. First, a new epidemiological meta-population model is constructed, with 379 patches (one for each administrative district in Great Britain), that adequately captures the infection process of pandemic influenza. Second, a ground truth is set up such that the performance of the \\'Proximal Policy Optimization\\' algorithm can be evaluated to learn in a single district of this epidemiological model. Finally, a large-scale experiment is conducted where a joint policy is learned to control the districts in a community of 11 tightly coupled districts, for which no ground truth can be established. This experiment shows that deep reinforcement learning can be used to learn mitigation policies in complex epidemiological models with a large state space. Moreover, through this experiment, it is demonstrated that there can be an advantage to consider collaboration between districts when designing prevention strategies<sup><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.13676v1.pdf?sv=2022-11-02&ss=bf&srt=sco&sp=rltfx&se=2023-11-29T01:50:59Z&st=2023-05-10T16:50:59Z&spr=https&sig=ZT7MLy%2BnlvAxUKKj5v0RwoWObXaab3gO4ec2%2Fci6iL0%3D\">[2]</a></sup>.', additional_kwargs={}, example=False)]"
