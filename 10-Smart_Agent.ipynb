    "- **Notebook 03**: We added AzureOpenAI GPT models to enhance the the production of the answer by using Utility Chains of LLMs\n",
    "- **Notebook 04**: We loaded a vector-based index with large/complex PDFs information , \"cogsrch-index-books-vector\"\n",
    "- **Notebook 05**: We added memory to our system in order to power a conversational Chat Bot\n",
    "- **Notebook 06**: We introduced Agents and Tools in order to be able to solve a more complex task: ask questions to Tabular datasets\n",
    "- **Notebook 07**: We used a SQL Agent in order to talk to a SQL Database directly\n",
    "- **Notebook 08**: We used another ReAct Agent in order to talk to the Bing Search API and create a Bing Chat Clone and implemented callbacks for real-time streaming and tool information\n",
    "- **Notebook 09**: We built an API Agent that can translate a question into the right API calls, giving us the capability to talk to any datasource that provides a RESTFul API.\n",

The goal is that, regardless of the source of the information (Search Engine, Bing Search, SQL Database, CSV File, JSON File, APIs, etc), the Assistant can answer the question correctly using the right tool.\n",
